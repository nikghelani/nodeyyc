        <p>Greg Brkich has been considered a good MLA, but in light of his “all lives matter” remark, maybe we all need to reconsider what being a good MLA actually means.
            Choosing those as the last three words the Arm River-Watrous MLA would utter in the Saskatchewan assembly was not being a good MLA. If anything, it was undoing an entire career of whatever good he might have done.</p>
